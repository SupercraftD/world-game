# World Game
Just a small open world game I am making in p5.js. I have many side projects, but I'm just putting this one onto github because I think it's pretty good and I will be working on it for a little bit more, so github can track my work. This game is web-based, so the current version on the github repo main branch will be up on github pages at https://supercraftd.github.io/world-game/


## Current Features:

### New:
1. Added whole game (8-24-23)

### Current Key Features:
1. a tile-based world, with different props, types, and properties assignable to each tile.
2. a chunk-based generation system, each 20x20 tiles. Chunks and tiles vary.
3. smooth player movement system, with differing modifiers to speed depending on environment
4. interact with nearby tiles and props
5. an inventory system
6. player stats that get modified by external factors
7. UI with minimap, inventory, stat bars

### Upcoming Features:
#### High priority (work on now):
1. Food and energy stats
2. consuming items from inventory
#### Low priority (work on later):
1. crafting
2. building
3. survival aspects
