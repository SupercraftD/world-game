# World Game
Just a small open world game I am making in p5.js. I have many side projects, but I'm just putting this one onto github because I think it's pretty good and I will be working on it for a little bit more, so github can track my work.


## Current Features:
1. a tile-based world, with different props, types, and properties assignable to each tile.
2. a chunk-based generation system, each 20x20 tiles. These chunks can be mostly grass, mostly water, or a mix. Random props like berry bushes spawn on grass too.
3. smooth player movement system, with differing modifiers to speed depending on environment
4. a way to interact with nearby tiles by clicking on their interactable props
5. an inventory system, currently with 9 slots for your hotbar
6. a minimap
7. player stats that get modified by external factors
8. UI stat bars that display those stats, when relevant

## Contributing:
I don't mind if you contribute, just try to sort of follow the class system I've created with the different files, functions, and classes.
